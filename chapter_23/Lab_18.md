## How to Develop a Pix2Pix End-to-End

The Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, is an approach to training a deep
convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation tasks. The careful configuration of
architecture as a type of image-conditional GAN allows for both the generation of large images
compared to prior GAN models (e.g. such as 256 × 256 pixels) and the capability of performing
well on a variety of different image-to-image translation tasks. In this tutorial, you will discover
how to develop a Pix2Pix generative adversarial network for image-to-image translation.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- How to load and prepare the satellite image to Google maps image-to-image translation
dataset.
- How to develop a Pix2Pix model for translating satellite photographs to Google Maps
images.
- How to use the final Pix2Pix generator model to translate ad hoc satellite images.

Let’s get started.



## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are:
1. What Is the Pix2Pix GAN?
2. Satellite to Map Image Translation Dataset
3. How to Develop and Train a Pix2Pix Model
4. How to Translate Images With a Pix2Pix Model
5. How to Translate Google Maps to Satellite Images



## What Is the Pix2Pix GAN?

Pix2Pix is a Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, model designed for general purpose
image-to-image translation. The approach was presented by Phillip Isola, et al. in their 2016
paper titled Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks and presented
at CVPR in 2017 (introduced in Chapter 21). The GAN architecture is comprised of a generator
model for outputting new plausible synthetic images, and a discriminator model that classifies
images as real (from the dataset) or fake (generated). The discriminator model is updated
directly, whereas the generator model is updated via the discriminator model. As such, the two
models are trained simultaneously in an adversarial process where the generator seeks to better
fool the discriminator and the discriminator seeks to better identify the counterfeit images.
The Pix2Pix model is a type of conditional GAN, or cGAN, where the generation of the
output image is conditional on an input, in this case, a source image. The discriminator is
provided both with a source image and the target image and must determine whether the target
is a plausible transformation of the source image. The generator is trained via adversarial loss,
which encourages the generator to generate plausible images in the target domain. The generator
is also updated via L1 loss measured between the generated image and the expected output
image. This additional loss encourages the generator model to create plausible translations of
the source image.
The Pix2Pix GAN has been demonstrated on a range of image-to-image translation tasks
such as converting maps to satellite photographs, black and white photographs to color, and
sketches of products to product photographs. Now that we are familiar with the Pix2Pix GAN,
let’s prepare a dataset that we can use with image-to-image translation.



## Satellite to Map Image Translation Dataset

In this tutorial, we will use the so-called maps dataset used in the Pix2Pix paper. This is a
dataset comprised of satellite images of New York and their corresponding Google maps pages.
The image translation problem involves converting satellite photos to Google maps format, or
the reverse, Google maps images to Satellite photos. The dataset is provided on the Pix2Pix
website and can be downloaded as a 255-megabyte zip file.

- Download Maps Dataset (maps.tar.gz).

Download the dataset and unzip it into your current working directory. This will create a
directory called maps/ with the following structure:

```
maps
train
val

```

The train folder contains 1,097 images, whereas the validation dataset contains 1,099 images.
Images have a digit filename and are in JPEG format. Each image is 1,200 pixels wide and 600
pixels tall and contains both the satellite image on the left and the Google maps image on the
right.

![](../images/503-126.jpg)


We can prepare this dataset for training a Pix2Pix GAN model in Keras. We will just work
with the images in the training dataset. Each image will be loaded, rescaled, and split into
the satellite and Google Maps elements. The result will be 1,097 color image pairs with the
width and height of 256 × 256 pixels. The load images() function below implements this. It
enumerates the list of images in a given directory, loads each with the target size of 256 × 512
pixels, splits each image into satellite and map elements and returns an array of each.

```
# load all images in a directory into memory
def load_images(path, size=(256,512)):
src_list, tar_list = list(), list()
# enumerate filenames in directory, assume all are images
for filename in listdir(path):
# load and resize the image
pixels = load_img(path + filename, target_size=size)
# convert to an array
pixels = img_to_array(pixels)
# split into satellite and map
sat_img, map_img = pixels[:, :256], pixels[:, 256:]
src_list.append(sat_img)
tar_list.append(map_img)
return [asarray(src_list), asarray(tar_list)]

```

We can call this function with the path to the training dataset. Once loaded, we can save
the prepared arrays to a new file in compressed format for later use. The complete example is
listed below.

```
# load, split and scale the maps dataset ready for training
from os import listdir
from numpy import asarray
from keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array


from keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
from numpy import savez_compressed
# load all images in a directory into memory
def load_images(path, size=(256,512)):
src_list, tar_list = list(), list()
# enumerate filenames in directory, assume all are images
for filename in listdir(path):
# load and resize the image
pixels = load_img(path + filename, target_size=size)
# convert to numpy array
pixels = img_to_array(pixels)
# split into satellite and map
sat_img, map_img = pixels[:, :256], pixels[:, 256:]
src_list.append(sat_img)
tar_list.append(map_img)
return [asarray(src_list), asarray(tar_list)]
# dataset path
path = 'maps/train/'
# load dataset
[src_images, tar_images] = load_images(path)
print('Loaded: ', src_images.shape, tar_images.shape)
# save as compressed numpy array
filename = 'maps_256.npz'
savez_compressed(filename, src_images, tar_images)
print('Saved dataset: ', filename)

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `01_prepare_dataset.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook

Running the example loads all images in the training dataset, summarizes their shape to
ensure the images were loaded correctly, then saves the arrays to a new file called maps 256.npz
in compressed NumPy array format.

```
Loaded: (1096, 256, 256, 3) (1096, 256, 256, 3)
Saved dataset: maps_256.npz

```

This file can be loaded later via the load() NumPy function and retrieving each array in
turn. We can then plot some images pairs to confirm the data has been handled correctly.

```
# load the prepared dataset
from numpy import load
from matplotlib import pyplot
# load the face dataset
data = load('maps_256.npz')
src_images, tar_images = data['arr_0'], data['arr_1']
print('Loaded: ', src_images.shape, tar_images.shape)
# plot source images
n_samples = 3
for i in range(n_samples):
pyplot.subplot(2, n_samples, 1 + i)
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.imshow(src_images[i].astype('uint8'))
# plot target image
for i in range(n_samples):



pyplot.subplot(2, n_samples, 1 + n_samples + i)
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.imshow(tar_images[i].astype('uint8'))
pyplot.show()

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `02_load_plot_dataset.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Running this example loads the prepared dataset and summarizes the shape of each array,
confirming our expectations of a little over one thousand 256 × 256 image pairs.

```
Loaded: (1096, 256, 256, 3) (1096, 256, 256, 3)

```

A plot of three image pairs is also created showing the satellite images on the top and
Google Maps images on the bottom. We can see that satellite images are quite complex and
that although the Google Maps images are much simpler, they have color codings for things like
major roads, water, and parks.

Now that we have prepared the dataset for image translation, we can develop our Pix2Pix
GAN model.


## How to Develop and Train a Pix2Pix Model

In this section, we will develop the Pix2Pix model for translating satellite photos to Google
maps images. The same model architecture and configuration described in the paper was used
across a range of image translation tasks. This architecture is both described in the body of the
paper, with additional detail in the appendix of the paper, and a fully working implementation
provided as open source with the Torch deep learning framework. The implementation in this
section will use the Keras deep learning framework based directly on the model described in
the paper and implemented in the author’s code base, designed to take and generate color
images with the size 256 × 256 pixels (model implementation was covered in Chapter 22). The
architecture is comprised of two models: the discriminator and the generator.
The discriminator is a deep convolutional neural network that performs image classification.
Specifically, conditional-image classification. It takes both the source image (e.g. satellite photo)
and the target image (e.g. Google maps image) as input and predicts the likelihood of whether
target image is a real or fake translation of the source image. The discriminator design is based
on the effective receptive field of the model, which defines the relationship between one output
of the model to the number of pixels in the input image. This is called a PatchGAN model and
is carefully designed so that each output prediction of the model maps to a 70 × 70 square or
patch of the input image. The benefit of this approach is that the same model can be applied
to input images of different sizes, e.g. larger or smaller than 256 × 256 pixels. The output of
the model depends on the size of the input image but may be one value or a square activation
map of values. Each value is a probability for the likelihood that a patch in the input image is
real. These values can be averaged to give an overall likelihood or classification score if needed.
The define discriminator() function below implements the 70 × 70 PatchGAN discriminator model as per the design of the model in the paper. The model takes two input images that
are concatenated together and predicts a patch output of predictions. The model is optimized
using binary cross-entropy, and a weighting is used so that updates to the model have half (0.5)
the usual effect. The authors of Pix2Pix recommend this weighting of model updates to slow
down changes to the discriminator, relative to the generator model during training.

```
# define the discriminator model
def define_discriminator(image_shape):
# weight initialization
init = RandomNormal(stddev=0.02)
# source image input
in_src_image = Input(shape=image_shape)
# target image input
in_target_image = Input(shape=image_shape)
# concatenate images channel-wise
merged = Concatenate()([in_src_image, in_target_image])
# C64
d = Conv2D(64, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(merged)
d = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(d)
# C128
d = Conv2D(128, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(d)
d = BatchNormalization()(d)
d = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(d)
# C256
d = Conv2D(256, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(d)
d = BatchNormalization()(d)
d = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(d)


# C512
d = Conv2D(512, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(d)
d = BatchNormalization()(d)
d = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(d)
# second last output layer
d = Conv2D(512, (4,4), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(d)
d = BatchNormalization()(d)
d = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(d)
# patch output
d = Conv2D(1, (4,4), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(d)
patch_out = Activation('sigmoid')(d)
# define model
model = Model([in_src_image, in_target_image], patch_out)
# compile model
opt = Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=opt, loss_weights=[0.5])
return model

```

The generator model is more complex than the discriminator model. The generator is
an encoder-decoder model using a U-Net architecture. The model takes a source image (e.g.
satellite photo) and generates a target image (e.g. Google maps image). It does this by first
downsampling or encoding the input image down to a bottleneck layer, then upsampling or
decoding the bottleneck representation to the size of the output image. The U-Net architecture
means that skip-connections are added between the encoding layers and the corresponding
decoding layers, forming a U-shape. The encoder and decoder of the generator are comprised of
standardized blocks of convolutional, batch normalization, dropout, and activation layers. This
standardization means that we can develop helper functions to create each block of layers and
call it repeatedly to build-up the encoder and decoder parts of the model.
The define generator() function below implements the U-Net encoder-decoder generator
model. It uses the define encoder block() helper function to create blocks of layers for the
encoder and the decoder block() function to create blocks of layers for the decoder. The Tanh
activation function is used in the output layer, meaning that pixel values in the generated image
will be in the range [-1,1].

```
# define an encoder block
def define_encoder_block(layer_in, n_filters, batchnorm=True):
# weight initialization
init = RandomNormal(stddev=0.02)
# add downsampling layer
g = Conv2D(n_filters, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same',
kernel_initializer=init)(layer_in)
# conditionally add batch normalization
if batchnorm:
g = BatchNormalization()(g, training=True)
# leaky relu activation
g = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(g)
return g
# define a decoder block
def decoder_block(layer_in, skip_in, n_filters, dropout=True):
# weight initialization
init = RandomNormal(stddev=0.02)



# add upsampling layer
g = Conv2DTranspose(n_filters, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same',
kernel_initializer=init)(layer_in)
# add batch normalization
g = BatchNormalization()(g, training=True)
# conditionally add dropout
if dropout:
g = Dropout(0.5)(g, training=True)
# merge with skip connection
g = Concatenate()([g, skip_in])
# relu activation
g = Activation('relu')(g)
return g
# define the standalone generator model
def define_generator(image_shape=(256,256,3)):
# weight initialization
init = RandomNormal(stddev=0.02)
# image input
in_image = Input(shape=image_shape)
# encoder model
e1 = define_encoder_block(in_image, 64, batchnorm=False)
e2 = define_encoder_block(e1, 128)
e3 = define_encoder_block(e2, 256)
e4 = define_encoder_block(e3, 512)
e5 = define_encoder_block(e4, 512)
e6 = define_encoder_block(e5, 512)
e7 = define_encoder_block(e6, 512)
# bottleneck, no batch norm and relu
b = Conv2D(512, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(e7)
b = Activation('relu')(b)
# decoder model
d1 = decoder_block(b, e7, 512)
d2 = decoder_block(d1, e6, 512)
d3 = decoder_block(d2, e5, 512)
d4 = decoder_block(d3, e4, 512, dropout=False)
d5 = decoder_block(d4, e3, 256, dropout=False)
d6 = decoder_block(d5, e2, 128, dropout=False)
d7 = decoder_block(d6, e1, 64, dropout=False)
# output
g = Conv2DTranspose(3, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(d7)
out_image = Activation('tanh')(g)
# define model
model = Model(in_image, out_image)
return model

```

The discriminator model is trained directly on real and generated images, whereas the
generator model is not. Instead, the generator model is trained via the discriminator model. It
is updated to minimize the loss predicted by the discriminator for generated images marked as
real. As such, it is encouraged to generate more realistic images. The generator is also updated
to minimize the L1 loss or mean absolute error between the generated image and the target
image. The generator is updated via a weighted sum of both the adversarial loss and the L1
loss, where the authors of the model recommend a weighting of 100 to 1 in favor of the L1 loss.



This is to encourage the generator strongly toward generating plausible translations of the input
image, and not just plausible images in the target domain.
This can be achieved by defining a new logical model comprised of the weights in the existing
standalone generator and discriminator model. This logical or composite model involves stacking
the generator on top of the discriminator. A source image is provided as input to the generator
and to the discriminator, although the output of the generator is connected to the discriminator
as the corresponding target image. The discriminator then predicts the likelihood that the
generated image was a real translation of the source image. The discriminator is updated
in a standalone manner, so the weights are reused in this composite model but are marked
as not trainable. The composite model is updated with two targets, one indicating that the
generated images were real (cross-entropy loss), forcing large weight updates in the generator
toward generating more realistic images, and the executed real translation of the image, which is
compared against the output of the generator model (L1 loss). The define gan() function below
implements this, taking the already-defined generator and discriminator models as arguments
and using the Keras functional API to connect them together into a composite model. Both
loss functions are specified for the two outputs of the model and the weights used for each are
specified in the loss weights argument to the compile() function.

```
# define the combined generator and discriminator model, for updating the generator
def define_gan(g_model, d_model, image_shape):
# make weights in the discriminator not trainable
d_model.trainable = False
# define the source image
in_src = Input(shape=image_shape)
# connect the source image to the generator input
gen_out = g_model(in_src)
# connect the source input and generator output to the discriminator input
dis_out = d_model([in_src, gen_out])
# src image as input, generated image and classification output
model = Model(in_src, [dis_out, gen_out])
# compile model
opt = Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5)
model.compile(loss=['binary_crossentropy', 'mae'], optimizer=opt, loss_weights=[1,100])
return model

```

Next, we can load our paired images dataset in compressed NumPy array format. This will
return a list of two NumPy arrays: the first for source images and the second for corresponding
target images.

```
# load and prepare training images
def load_real_samples(filename):
# load the compressed arrays
data = load(filename)
# unpack the arrays
X1, X2 = data['arr_0'], data['arr_1']
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
X1 = (X1 - 127.5) / 127.5
X2 = (X2 - 127.5) / 127.5
return [X1, X2]

```


Training the discriminator will require batches of real and fake images. The generate real samples()
function below will prepare a batch of random pairs of images from the training dataset, and
the corresponding discriminator label of class = 1 to indicate they are real.

```
# select a batch of random samples, returns images and target
def generate_real_samples(dataset, n_samples, patch_shape):
# unpack dataset
trainA, trainB = dataset
# choose random instances
ix = randint(0, trainA.shape[0], n_samples)
# retrieve selected images
X1, X2 = trainA[ix], trainB[ix]
# generate 'real' class labels (1)
y = ones((n_samples, patch_shape, patch_shape, 1))
return [X1, X2], y

```

The generate fake samples() function below uses the generator model and a batch of real
source images to generate an equivalent batch of target images for the discriminator. These are
returned with the label class = 0 to indicate to the discriminator that they are fake.

```
# generate a batch of images, returns images and targets
def generate_fake_samples(g_model, samples, patch_shape):
# generate fake instance
X = g_model.predict(samples)
# create 'fake' class labels (0)
y = zeros((len(X), patch_shape, patch_shape, 1))
return X, y

```

Typically, GAN models do not converge; instead, an equilibrium is found between the
generator and discriminator models. As such, we cannot easily judge when training should stop.
Therefore, we can save the model and use it to generate sample image-to-image translations
periodically during training, such as every 10 training epochs. We can then review the generated images at the end of training and use the image quality to choose a final model. The
summarize performance() function implements this, taking the generator model at a point
during training and using it to generate a number, in this case three, of translations of randomly
selected images in the dataset. The source, generated image, and expected target are then
plotted as three rows of images and the plot saved to file. Additionally, the model is saved to an
H5 formatted file that makes it easier to load later. Both the image and model filenames include
the training iteration number, allowing us to easily tell them apart at the end of training.

```
# generate samples and save as a plot and save the model
def summarize_performance(step, g_model, dataset, n_samples=3):
# select a sample of input images
[X_realA, X_realB], _ = generate_real_samples(dataset, n_samples, 1)
# generate a batch of fake samples
X_fakeB, _ = generate_fake_samples(g_model, X_realA, 1)
# scale all pixels from [-1,1] to [0,1]
X_realA = (X_realA + 1) / 2.0
X_realB = (X_realB + 1) / 2.0
X_fakeB = (X_fakeB + 1) / 2.0
# plot real source images


for i in range(n_samples):
pyplot.subplot(3, n_samples, 1 + i)
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.imshow(X_realA[i])
# plot generated target image
for i in range(n_samples):
pyplot.subplot(3, n_samples, 1 + n_samples + i)
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.imshow(X_fakeB[i])
# plot real target image
for i in range(n_samples):
pyplot.subplot(3, n_samples, 1 + n_samples*2 + i)
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.imshow(X_realB[i])
# save plot to file
filename1 = 'plot_%06d.png' % (step+1)
pyplot.savefig(filename1)
pyplot.close()
# save the generator model
filename2 = 'model_%06d.h5' % (step+1)
g_model.save(filename2)
print('>Saved: %s and %s' % (filename1, filename2))

```

Finally, we can train the generator and discriminator models. The train() function below
implements this, taking the defined generator, discriminator, composite model, and loaded
dataset as input. The number of epochs is set at 100 to keep training times down, although
200 was used in the paper. A batch size of 1 is used as is recommended in the paper. Training
involves a fixed number of training iterations. There are 1,097 images in the training dataset.
One epoch is one iteration through this number of examples, with a batch size of one means
1,097 training steps. The generator is saved and evaluated every 10 epochs or every 10,097
training steps, and the model will run for 100 epochs, or a total of 100,097 training steps.
Each training step involves first selecting a batch of real examples, then using the generator to
generate a batch of matching fake samples using the real source images. The discriminator is
then updated with the batch of real images and then fake images.
Next, the generator model is updated providing the real source images as input and providing
class labels of 1 (real) and the real target images as the expected outputs of the model required
for calculating loss. The generator has two loss scores as well as the weighted sum score returned
from the call to train on batch(). We are only interested in the weighted sum score (the first
value returned) as it is used to update the model weights. Finally, the loss for each update is
reported to the console each training iteration and model performance is evaluated every 10
training epochs.

```
# train pix2pix model
def train(d_model, g_model, gan_model, dataset, n_epochs=100, n_batch=1):
# determine the output square shape of the discriminator
n_patch = d_model.output_shape[1]
# unpack dataset
trainA, trainB = dataset
# calculate the number of batches per training epoch
bat_per_epo = int(len(trainA) / n_batch)


# calculate the number of training iterations
n_steps = bat_per_epo * n_epochs
# manually enumerate epochs
for i in range(n_steps):
# select a batch of real samples
[X_realA, X_realB], y_real = generate_real_samples(dataset, n_batch, n_patch)
# generate a batch of fake samples
X_fakeB, y_fake = generate_fake_samples(g_model, X_realA, n_patch)
# update discriminator for real samples
d_loss1 = d_model.train_on_batch([X_realA, X_realB], y_real)
# update discriminator for generated samples
d_loss2 = d_model.train_on_batch([X_realA, X_fakeB], y_fake)
# update the generator
g_loss, _, _ = gan_model.train_on_batch(X_realA, [y_real, X_realB])
# summarize performance
print('>%d, d1[%.3f] d2[%.3f] g[%.3f]' % (i+1, d_loss1, d_loss2, g_loss))
# summarize model performance
if (i+1) % (bat_per_epo * 10) == 0:
summarize_performance(i, g_model, dataset)

```

Tying all of this together, the complete code example of training a Pix2Pix GAN to translate
satellite photos to Google maps images is listed below.

The loss is reported each training iteration, including the discriminator loss on real examples
(d1), discriminator loss on generated or fake examples (d2), and generator loss, which is a
weighted average of adversarial and L1 loss (g). If loss for the discriminator goes to zero and


stays there for a long time, consider re-starting the training run as it is an example of a training
failure.

Models are saved every 10 epochs and saved to a file with the training iteration number.
Additionally, images are generated every 10 epochs and compared to the expected target images.
These plots can be assessed at the end of the run and used to select a final generator model
based on generated image quality. At the end of the run, will you will have 10 saved model
files and 10 plots of generated images. After the first 10 epochs, map images are generated that
look plausible, although the lines for streets are not entirely straight and images contain some
blurring. Nevertheless, large structures are in the right places with mostly the right colors.



![](../images/518-128.jpg)


Generated images after about 50 training epochs begin to look very realistic, and the quality
appears to remain good for the remainder of the training process. The first generated image
example below (left column, middle row) includes more useful detail than the real Google Maps
image.


![](../images/519-129.jpg)


Now that we have developed and trained the Pix2Pix model, we can explore how they can
be used in a standalone manner.


## How to Translate Images With a Pix2Pix Model

Training the Pix2Pix model results in many saved models and samples of generated images for
each. More training epochs does not necessarily mean a better quality model. Therefore, we
can choose a model based on the quality of the generated images and use it to perform ad hoc
image-to-image translation. In this case, we will use the model saved at the end of the run, e.g.
after 10 0epochs or 109,600 training iterations. A good starting point is to load the model and
use it to make ad hoc translations of source images in the training dataset. First, we can load
the training dataset. We can use the same function named load real samples() for loading
the dataset as was used when training the model.

```
# load and prepare training images
def load_real_samples(filename):
# load the compressed arrays
data = load(filename)
# unpack the arrays
X1, X2 = data['arr_0'], data['arr_1']


# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
X1 = (X1 - 127.5) / 127.5
X2 = (X2 - 127.5) / 127.5
return [X1, X2]

```

This function can be called as follows:

```
...
# load dataset
[X1, X2] = load_real_samples('maps_256.npz')
print('Loaded', X1.shape, X2.shape)

```

Next, we can load the saved Keras model.

```
...
# load model
model = load_model('model_109600.h5')

```

Next, we can choose a random image pair from the training dataset to use as an example.

```
...
# select random example
ix = randint(0, len(X1), 1)
src_image, tar_image = X1[ix], X2[ix]

```

We can provide the source satellite image as input to the model and use it to predict a
Google Maps image.

```
...
# generate image from source
gen_image = model.predict(src_image)

```

Finally, we can plot the source, generated image, and the expected target image. The
plot images() function below implements this, providing a nice title above each image.

```
# plot source, generated and target images
def plot_images(src_img, gen_img, tar_img):
images = vstack((src_img, gen_img, tar_img))
# scale from [-1,1] to [0,1]
images = (images + 1) / 2.0
titles = ['Source', 'Generated', 'Expected']
# plot images row by row
for i in range(len(images)):
# define subplot
pyplot.subplot(1, 3, 1 + i)
# turn off axis
pyplot.axis('off')
# plot raw pixel data
pyplot.imshow(images[i])



# show title
pyplot.title(titles[i])
pyplot.show()

```

This function can be called with each of our source, generated, and target images.

```
...
# plot all three images
plot_images(src_image, gen_image, tar_image)

```

Tying all of this together, the complete example of performing an ad hoc image-to-image
translation with an example from the training dataset is listed below.

```
# example of loading a pix2pix model and using it for image to image translation
from keras.models import load_model
from numpy import load
from numpy import vstack
from matplotlib import pyplot
from numpy.random import randint
# load and prepare training images
def load_real_samples(filename):
# load the compressed arrays
data = load(filename)
# unpack the arrays
X1, X2 = data['arr_0'], data['arr_1']
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
X1 = (X1 - 127.5) / 127.5
X2 = (X2 - 127.5) / 127.5
return [X1, X2]
# plot source, generated and target images
def plot_images(src_img, gen_img, tar_img):
images = vstack((src_img, gen_img, tar_img))
# scale from [-1,1] to [0,1]
images = (images + 1) / 2.0
titles = ['Source', 'Generated', 'Expected']
# plot images row by row
for i in range(len(images)):
# define subplot
pyplot.subplot(1, 3, 1 + i)
# turn off axis
pyplot.axis('off')
# plot raw pixel data
pyplot.imshow(images[i])
# show title
pyplot.title(titles[i])
pyplot.show()
# load dataset
[X1, X2] = load_real_samples('maps_256.npz')
print('Loaded', X1.shape, X2.shape)
# load model


model = load_model('model_109600.h5')
# select random example
ix = randint(0, len(X1), 1)
src_image, tar_image = X1[ix], X2[ix]
# generate image from source
gen_image = model.predict(src_image)
# plot all three images
plot_images(src_image, gen_image, tar_image)

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `04_inference_pix2pix.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Running the example will select a random image from the training dataset, translate it to a
Google Maps, and plot the result compared to the expected image.

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Your specific results may vary given the stochastic nature of the learning algorithm.
Consider running the example a few times and compare the average performance.

In this case, we can see that the generated image captures large roads with orange and
yellow as well as green park areas. The generated image is not perfect but is very close to the
expected image.

![](../images/522-130.jpg)



We may also want to use the model to translate a given standalone image. We can select
an image from the validation dataset under maps/val/ and crop the satellite element of the
image. This can then be saved and used as input to the model. In this case, we will use
maps/val/1.jpg.

![](../images/523-131.jpg)

We can use an image program to create a rough crop of the satellite element of this image
to use as input and save the file as satellite.jpg in the current working directory.

![](../images/523-132.jpg)

We must load the image as a NumPy array of pixels with the size of 256 × 256, rescale the


pixel values to the range [-1,1], and then expand the single image dimensions to represent one
input sample. The load image() function below implements this, returning image pixels that
can be provided directly to a loaded Pix2Pix model.

```
# load an image
def load_image(filename, size=(256,256)):
# load image with the preferred size
pixels = load_img(filename, target_size=size)
# convert to an array
pixels = img_to_array(pixels)
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
pixels = (pixels - 127.5) / 127.5
# reshape to 1 sample
pixels = expand_dims(pixels, 0)
return pixels

```

We can then load our cropped satellite image.

```
...
# load source image
src_image = load_image('satellite.jpg')
print('Loaded', src_image.shape)

```

As before, we can load our saved Pix2Pix generator model and generate a translation of the
loaded image.

```
...
# load model
model = load_model('model_109600.h5')
# generate image from source
gen_image = model.predict(src_image)

```

Finally, we can scale the pixel values back to the range [0,1] and plot the result.

```
...
# scale from [-1,1] to [0,1]
gen_image = (gen_image + 1) / 2.0
# plot the image
pyplot.imshow(gen_image[0])
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.show()

```

Tying this all together, the complete example of performing an ad hoc image translation
with a single image file is listed below.

```
# example of loading a pix2pix model and using it for one-off image translation
from keras.models import load_model
from keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array
from keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
from numpy import expand_dims
from matplotlib import pyplot


# load an image
def load_image(filename, size=(256,256)):
# load image with the preferred size
pixels = load_img(filename, target_size=size)
# convert to numpy array
pixels = img_to_array(pixels)
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
pixels = (pixels - 127.5) / 127.5
# reshape to 1 sample
pixels = expand_dims(pixels, 0)
return pixels
# load source image
src_image = load_image('satellite.jpg')
print('Loaded', src_image.shape)
# load model
model = load_model('model_109600.h5')
# generate image from source
gen_image = model.predict(src_image)
# scale from [-1,1] to [0,1]
gen_image = (gen_image + 1) / 2.0
# plot the image
pyplot.imshow(gen_image[0])
pyplot.axis('off')
pyplot.show()

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `05_translate_single_image.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Running the example loads the image from file, creates a translation of it, and plots the
result. The generated image appears to be a reasonable translation of the source image. The
streets do not appear to be straight lines and the detail of the buildings is a bit lacking. Perhaps
with further training or choice of a different model, higher-quality images could be generated.



![](../images/526-133.jpg)


## How to Translate Google Maps to Satellite Images

Now that we are familiar with how to develop and use a Pix2Pix model for translating satellite
images to Google maps, we can also explore the reverse. That is, we can develop a Pix2Pix
model to translate Google Maps images to plausible satellite images. This requires that the
model invent (or hallucinate) plausible buildings, roads, parks, and more. We can use the same
code to train the model with one small difference. We can change the order of the datasets
returned from the load real samples() function; for example:

```
# load and prepare training images
def load_real_samples(filename):
# load the compressed arrays
data = load(filename)
# unpack the arrays
X1, X2 = data['arr_0'], data['arr_1']
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
X1 = (X1 - 127.5) / 127.5
X2 = (X2 - 127.5) / 127.5
# return in reverse order
return [X2, X1]


```

The order of X1 and X2 is reversed in this version of the function. This means that the model
will take Google Maps images as input and learn to generate satellite images. The complete
example is omitted here for brevity. Run the example as before.

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `06_train_pix2pix_reverse.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Running the example may take many hours to run on CPU hardware. I recommend

goes to zero and stays there for a long time, consider re-starting the training run as it is an
example of a training failure.

>109600, d1[0.279] d2[0.049] g[9.941]
>Saved: plot_109600.png and model_109600.h5

```


It is harder to judge the quality of generated satellite images, nevertheless, plausible images
are generated after just 10 epochs.


![](../images/528-134.jpg)


As before, image quality will improve and will continue to vary over the training process. A
final model can be chosen based on generated image quality, not total training epochs. The
model appears to have little difficulty in generating reasonable water, parks, roads, and more.

## Extensions

This section lists some ideas for extending the tutorial that you may wish to explore.

- Standalone Satellite. Develop an example of translating standalone Google Maps
images to satellite images, as we did for satellite to Google Maps images.
- New Image. Locate a satellite image for an entirely new location and translate it to a
Google Maps and consider the result compared to the actual image in Google maps.
- More Training. Continue training the model for another 100 epochs and evaluate
whether the additional training results in further improvements in image quality.
- Image Augmentation. Use some minor image augmentation during training as described
in the Pix2Pix paper and evaluate whether it results in better quality generated images.

If you explore any of these extensions, I’d love to know.
