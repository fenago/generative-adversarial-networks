## How to Implement CycleGAN Models

The Cycle Generative adversarial Network, or CycleGAN for short, is a generator model for
converting images from one domain to another domain. For example, the model can be used to
translate images of horses to images of zebras, or photographs of city landscapes at night to city
landscapes during the day. The benefit of the CycleGAN model is that it can be trained without
paired examples. That is, it does not require examples of photographs before and after the
translation in order to train the model, e.g. photos of the same city landscape during the day and
at night. Instead, it is able to use a collection of photographs from each domain and extract and
harness the underlying style of images in the collection in order to perform the translation. The
model is very impressive but has an architecture that appears quite complicated to implement
for beginners. In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the CycleGAN architecture
from scratch using the Keras deep learning framework. After completing this tutorial, you will
know:

- How to implement the discriminator and generator models.
- How to define composite models to train the generator models via adversarial and cycle
loss.
- How to implement the training process to update model weights each training iteration.

Let’s get started.



## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are:

1. What Is the CycleGAN Architecture?
2. How to Implement the CycleGAN Discriminator Model
3. How to Implement the CycleGAN Generator Model
4. How to Implement Composite Models and Loss
5. How to Update Model Weights


## What Is the CycleGAN Architecture?

The CycleGAN model was described by Jun-Yan Zhu, et al. in their 2017 paper titled Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (introduced
in Chapter 24). The model architecture is comprised of two generator models: one generator
(Generator-A) for generating images for the first domain (Domain-A) and the second generator
(Generator-B) for generating images for the second domain (Domain-B).

- Generator-A → Domain-A
- Generator-B → Domain-B

The generator models perform image translation, meaning that the image generation process
is conditional on an input image, specifically an image from the other domain. Generator-A
takes an image from Domain-B as input and Generator-B takes an image from Domain-A as
input.

- Domain-B → Generator-A → Domain-A
- Domain-A → Generator-B → Domain-B

Each generator has a corresponding discriminator model. The first discriminator model
(Discriminator-A) takes real images from Domain-A and generated images from Generator-A
and predicts whether they are real or fake. The second discriminator model (Discriminator-B)
takes real images from Domain-B and generated images from Generator-B and predicts whether
they are real or fake.

- Domain-A → Discriminator-A → [Real/Fake]
- Domain-B → Generator-A → Discriminator-A → [Real/Fake]
- Domain-B → Discriminator-B → [Real/Fake]
- Domain-A → Generator-B → Discriminator-B → [Real/Fake]

The discriminator and generator models are trained in an adversarial zero-sum process,
like normal GAN models. The generators learn to better fool the discriminators and the
discriminators learn to better detect fake images. Together, the models find an equilibrium
during the training process. Additionally, the generator models are regularized not just to
create new images in the target domain, but instead create translated versions of the input
images from the source domain. This is achieved by using generated images as input to the
corresponding generator model and comparing the output image to the original images. Passing
an image through both generators is called a cycle. Together, each pair of generator models are
trained to better reproduce the original source image, referred to as cycle consistency.

- Domain-B → Generator-A → Domain-A → Generator-B → Domain-B
- Domain-A → Generator-B → Domain-B → Generator-A → Domain-A


There is one further element to the architecture referred to as the identity mapping. This is
where a generator is provided with images as input from the target domain and is expected to
generate the same image without change. This addition to the architecture is optional, although
it results in a better matching of the color profile of the input image.

- Domain-A → Generator-A → Domain-A
- Domain-B → Generator-B → Domain-B

Now that we are familiar with the model architecture, we can take a closer look at each
model in turn and how they can be implemented. The paper provides a good description of
the models and training process, although the official Torch implementation was used as the
definitive description for each model and training process and provides the basis for the model
implementations described below.



## How to Implement the CycleGAN Discriminator Model

The discriminator model is responsible for taking a real or generated image as input and
predicting whether it is real or fake. The discriminator model is implemented as a PatchGAN
model (described in detail in Chapter 22).

For the discriminator networks we use 70 × 70 PatchGANs, which aim to classify
whether 70 × 70 overlapping image patches are real or fake.

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.

The PatchGAN was described in the 2016 paper titled Precomputed Real-time Texture
Synthesis With Markovian Generative Adversarial Networks and was used in the Pix2Pix
model for image translation described in the 2016 paper titled Image-to-Image Translation with
Conditional Adversarial Networks. The architecture is described as discriminating an input
image as real or fake by averaging the prediction for n × n squares or patches of the source
image.

... we design a discriminator architecture - which we term a PatchGAN - that only
penalizes structure at the scale of patches. This discriminator tries to classify if each
N × N patch in an image is real or fake. We run this discriminator convolutionally
across the image, averaging all responses to provide the ultimate output of D.

— Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks, 2016.

This can be implemented directly by using a somewhat standard deep convolutional discriminator model. Instead of outputting a single value like a traditional discriminator model, the
PatchGAN discriminator model can output a square or one-channel feature map of predictions.
The 70 × 70 refers to the effective receptive field of the model on the input, not the actual shape
of the output feature map. The receptive field of a convolutional layer refers to the number of
pixels that one output of the layer maps to in the input to the layer. The effective receptive field


refers to the mapping of one pixel in the output of a deep convolutional model (multiple layers)
to the input image. Here, the PatchGAN is an approach to designing a deep convolutional
network based on the effective receptive field, where one output activation of the model maps
to a 70 × 70 patch of the input image, regardless of the size of the input image.
The PatchGAN has the effect of predicting whether each 70 × 70 patch in the input image
is real or fake. These predictions can then be averaged to give the output of the model (if
needed) or compared directly to a matrix (or a vector if flattened) of expected values (e.g. 0 or
1 values). The discriminator model described in the paper takes 256 × 256 color images as input
and defines an explicit architecture that is used on all of the test problems. The architecture
uses blocks of Conv2D-InstanceNorm-LeakyReLU layers, with 4 × 4 filters and a 2 × 2 stride.

Let Ck denote a 4 × 4 Convolution-InstanceNorm-LeakyReLU layer with k filters
and stride 2. After the last layer, we apply a convolution to produce a 1-dimensional
output. We do not use InstanceNorm for the first C64 layer. We use leaky ReLUs
with a slope of 0.2.

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.

The architecture for the discriminator is as: C64-C128-C256-C512. This is referred to as a
3-layer PatchGAN in the CycleGAN and Pix2Pix nomenclature, as excluding the first hidden
layer, the model has three hidden layers that could be scaled up or down to give different sized
PatchGAN models. Not listed in the paper, the model also has a final hidden layer C512 with a
1 × 1 stride, and an output layer C1, also with a 1 × 1 stride with a linear activation function.
Given the model is mostly used with 256 × 256 sized images as input, the size of the output
feature map of activations is 16 × 16. If 128 × 128 images were used as input, then the size of the
output feature map of activations would be 8 × 8. The model does not use batch normalization;
instead, instance normalization is used.
Instance normalization was described in the 2016 paper titled Instance Normalization: The
Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization. It is a very simple type of normalization and involves
standardizing (e.g. scaling to a standard Gaussian) the values on each feature map. The intent is
to remove image-specific contrast information from the image during image generation, resulting
in better generated images.

The key idea is to replace batch normalization layers in the generator architecture
with instance normalization layers, and to keep them at test time (as opposed to
freeze and simplify them out as done for batch normalization). Intuitively, the
normalization process allows to remove instance-specific contrast information from
the content image, which simplifies generation. In practice, this results in vastly
improved images.

— Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization, 2016.

Although designed for generator models, it can also prove effective in discriminator models.
An implementation of instance normalization is provided in the keras-contrib project that
provides early access to community-supplied Keras features. The keras-contrib library can
be installed via pip as follows:

```

sudo pip install git+https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git

```

Or, if you are using an Anaconda virtual environment, such as on EC2:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git
cd keras-contrib
sudo ~/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36/bin/python setup.py install

```

The new InstanceNormalization layer can then be used as follows:

```
...
from keras_contrib.layers.normalization.instancenormalization import InstanceNormalization
# define layer
layer = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)
...

```

The axis argument is set to -1 to ensure that features are normalized per feature map. The
network weights are initialized to Gaussian random numbers with a standard deviation of 0.02,
as is described for DCGANs more generally.

Weights are initialized from a Gaussian distribution N (0, 0.02).

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.

The discriminator model is updated using a least squares loss (L2), a so-called Least-Squared
Generative Adversarial Network, or LSGAN.

... we replace the negative log likelihood objective by a least-squares loss. This loss
is more stable during training and generates higher quality results.

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.

This can be implemented using mean squared error between the target values of class = 1
for real images and class = 0 for fake images. Additionally, the paper suggests dividing the
loss for the discriminator by half during training, in an effort to slow down updates to the
discriminator relative to the generator.

In practice, we divide the objective by 2 while optimizing D, which slows down the
rate at which D learns, relative to the rate of G.

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.
This can be achieved by setting the loss weights argument to 0.5 when compiling the
model. This weighting does not appear to be implemented in the official Torch implementation
when updating discriminator models are defined in the fDx basic() function1 . We can tie all

## How to Implement the CycleGAN Generator Model

The CycleGAN Generator model takes an image as input and generates a translated image as
output. The model uses a sequence of downsampling convolutional blocks to encode the input

image, a number of residual network (ResNet) convolutional blocks to transform the image, and
a number of upsampling convolutional blocks to generate the output image.

Let c7s1-k denote a 7 × 7 Convolution-InstanceNormReLU layer with k filters and
stride 1. dk denotes a 3 × 3 Convolution-InstanceNorm-ReLU layer with k filters
and stride 2. Reflection padding was used to reduce artifacts. Rk denotes a residual
block that contains two 3 × 3 convolutional layers with the same number of filters on
both layer. uk denotes a 3 × 3 fractional-strided-ConvolutionInstanceNorm-ReLU
layer with k filters and stride 12 .

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.

The architecture for the 6-resnet block generator for 128 × 128 images is as follows:

- c7s1-64,d128,d256,R256,R256,R256,R256,R256,R256,u128,u64,c7s1-3

First, we need a function to define the ResNet blocks. These are blocks comprised of two
3 × 3 CNN layers where the input to the block is concatenated to the output of the block,
channel-wise. This is implemented in the resnet block() function that creates two ConvInstanceNorm blocks with 3 × 3 filters and 1 × 1 stride and without a ReLU activation after the
second block, matching the official Torch implementation in the build conv block() function.
Same padding is used instead of reflection padded recommended in the paper for simplicity.

```
# generator a resnet block
def resnet_block(n_filters, input_layer):
# weight initialization
init = RandomNormal(stddev=0.02)
# first layer convolutional layer
g = Conv2D(n_filters, (3,3), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(input_layer)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
g = Activation('relu')(g)
# second convolutional layer
g = Conv2D(n_filters, (3,3), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(g)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
# concatenate merge channel-wise with input layer
g = Concatenate()([g, input_layer])
return g

```

Next, we can define a function that will create the 9-resnet block version for 256 × 256
input images. This can easily be changed to the 6-resnet block version by setting image shape
argument to (128 × 128 × 3) and n resnet function argument to 6. Importantly, the model
outputs pixel values with the shape as the input and pixel values are in the range [-1, 1], typical
for GAN generator models.

```
# define the standalone generator model
def define_generator(image_shape=(256,256,3), n_resnet=9):
# weight initialization
init = RandomNormal(stddev=0.02)
# image input
in_image = Input(shape=image_shape)
# c7s1-64

g = Conv2D(64, (7,7), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(in_image)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
g = Activation('relu')(g)
# d128
g = Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(g)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
g = Activation('relu')(g)
# d256
g = Conv2D(256, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(g)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
g = Activation('relu')(g)
# R256
for _ in range(n_resnet):
g = resnet_block(256, g)
# u128
g = Conv2DTranspose(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(g)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
g = Activation('relu')(g)
# u64
g = Conv2DTranspose(64, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(g)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
g = Activation('relu')(g)
# c7s1-3
g = Conv2D(3, (7,7), padding='same', kernel_initializer=init)(g)
g = InstanceNormalization(axis=-1)(g)
out_image = Activation('tanh')(g)
# define model
model = Model(in_image, out_image)
return model

```

The generator model is not compiled as it is trained via a composite model, seen in the next
section. Tying this together, the complete example is listed below.

## How to Implement Composite Models and Loss

The generator models are not updated directly. Instead, the generator models are updated via
composite models. An update to each generator model involves changes to the model weights
based on four concerns:

- Adversarial loss (L2 or mean squared error).
- Identity loss (L1 or mean absolute error).
- Forward cycle loss (L1 or mean absolute error).
- Backward cycle loss (L1 or mean absolute error).

The adversarial loss is the standard approach for updating the generator via the discriminator,
although in this case, the least squares loss function is used instead of the negative log likelihood
(e.g. binary cross-entropy). First, we can use our function to define the two generators and two
discriminators used in the CycleGAN.

```
...
# input shape
image_shape = (256,256,3)
# generator: A -> B
g_model_AtoB = define_generator(image_shape)
# generator: B -> A
g_model_BtoA = define_generator(image_shape)
# discriminator: A -> [real/fake]
d_model_A = define_discriminator(image_shape)
# discriminator: B -> [real/fake]
d_model_B = define_discriminator(image_shape)

```

A composite model is required for each generator model that is responsible for only updating
the weights of that generator model, although it is required to share the weights with the related
discriminator model and the other generator model. This can be achieved by marking the
weights of the other models as not trainable in the context of the composite model to ensure we
are only updating the intended generator.

```
...
# ensure the model we're updating is trainable
g_model_1.trainable = True
# mark discriminator as not trainable
d_model.trainable = False
# mark other generator model as not trainable
g_model_2.trainable = False

```

The model can be constructed piecewise using the Keras functional API. The first step is to
define the input of the real image from the source domain, pass it through our generator model,
then connect the output of the generator to the discriminator and classify it as real or fake.

```
...
# discriminator element
input_gen = Input(shape=image_shape)
gen1_out = g_model_1(input_gen)
output_d = d_model(gen1_out)

```

Next, we can connect the identity mapping element with a new input for the real image from
the target domain, pass it through our generator model, and output the (hopefully) untranslated
image directly.

```
...
# identity element
input_id = Input(shape=image_shape)
output_id = g_model_1(input_id)

```

So far, we have a composite model with two real image inputs and a discriminator classification
and identity image output. Next, we need to add the forward and backward cycles. The forward
cycle can be achieved by connecting the output of our generator to the other generator, the
output of which can be compared to the input to our generator and should be identical.

```
...
# forward cycle
output_f = g_model_2(gen1_out)

```

The backward cycle is more complex and involves the input for the real image from the
target domain passing through the other generator, then passing through our generator, which
should match the real image from the target domain.

```
...
# backward cycle
gen2_out = g_model_2(input_id)
output_b = g_model_1(gen2_out)

```

That’s it. We can then define this composite model with two inputs: one real image for the
source and the target domain, and four outputs, one for the discriminator, one for the generator
for the identity mapping, one for the other generator for the forward cycle, and one from our
generator for the backward cycle.

```
...
# define model graph
model = Model([input_gen, input_id], [output_d, output_id, output_f, output_b])

```

The adversarial loss for the discriminator output uses least squares loss which is implemented
as L2 or mean squared error. The outputs from the generators are compared to images and
are optimized using L1 loss implemented as mean absolute error. The generator is updated as
a weighted average of the four loss values. The adversarial loss is weighted normally, whereas


the forward and backward cycle loss is weighted using a parameter called lambda and is set to
10, e.g. 10 times more important than adversarial loss. The identity loss is also weighted as a
fraction of the lambda parameter and is set to 0.5 × 10 or 5 in the official Torch implementation.

```
...
# compile model with weighting of least squares loss and L1 loss
model.compile(loss=['mse', 'mae', 'mae', 'mae'], loss_weights=[1, 5, 10, 10], optimizer=opt)

```

We can tie all of this together and define the function define composite model() for
creating a composite model for training a given generator model.

```
# define a composite model for updating generators by adversarial and cycle loss
def define_composite_model(g_model_1, d_model, g_model_2, image_shape):
# ensure the model we're updating is trainable
g_model_1.trainable = True
# mark discriminator as not trainable
d_model.trainable = False
# mark other generator model as not trainable
g_model_2.trainable = False
# discriminator element
input_gen = Input(shape=image_shape)
gen1_out = g_model_1(input_gen)
output_d = d_model(gen1_out)
# identity element
input_id = Input(shape=image_shape)
output_id = g_model_1(input_id)
# forward cycle
output_f = g_model_2(gen1_out)
# backward cycle
gen2_out = g_model_2(input_id)
output_b = g_model_1(gen2_out)
# define model graph
model = Model([input_gen, input_id], [output_d, output_id, output_f, output_b])
# define optimization algorithm configuration
opt = Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5)
# compile model with weighting of least squares loss and L1 loss
model.compile(loss=['mse', 'mae', 'mae', 'mae'], loss_weights=[1, 5, 10, 10],
optimizer=opt)
return model

```

This function can then be called to prepare a composite model for training both the
g model AtoB generator model and the g model BtoA model; for example:

```
...
# composite: A ->
c_model_AtoBtoA =
# composite: B ->
c_model_BtoAtoB =

B -> [real/fake, A]
define_composite_model(g_model_AtoB, d_model_B, g_model_BtoA, image_shape)
A -> [real/fake, B]
define_composite_model(g_model_BtoA, d_model_A, g_model_AtoB, image_shape)

```

Summarizing and plotting the composite model is a bit of a mess as it does not help to see
the inputs and outputs of the model clearly. We can summarize the inputs and outputs for each


of the composite models below. Recall that we are sharing or reusing the same set of weights if
a given model is used more than once in the composite model.

- **Generator-A Composite Model:** Only Generator-A weights are trainable and weights
for other models and not trainable.
– **Adversarial**: Domain-B → Generator-A → Domain-A → Discriminator-A → [real/fake]
– **Identity**: Domain-A → Generator-A → Domain-A
– **Forward Cycle**: Domain-B → Generator-A → Domain-A → Generator-B →
Domain-B
– **Backward Cycle**: Domain-A → Generator-B → Domain-B → Generator-A →
Domain-A
- **Generator-B Composite Model**: Only Generator-B weights are trainable and weights
for other models are not trainable.

– **Adversarial**: Domain-A → Generator-B → Domain-B → Discriminator-B → [real/fake]
– **Identity**: Domain-B → Generator-B → Domain-B
– *8Forward Cycle**: Domain-A → Generator-B → Domain-B → Generator-A →
Domain-A
– **Backward Cycle**: Domain-B → Generator-A → Domain-A → Generator-B →
Domain-B

A complete example of creating all of the models is listed below for completeness.

## How to Update Model Weights

Training the defined models is relatively straightforward. First, we must define a helper function
that will select a batch of real images and the associated target (1.0).

```
# select a batch of random samples, returns images and target
def generate_real_samples(dataset, n_samples, patch_shape):
# choose random instances
ix = randint(0, dataset.shape[0], n_samples)
# retrieve selected images
X = dataset[ix]
# generate 'real' class labels (1)
y = ones((n_samples, patch_shape, patch_shape, 1))
return X, y

```

Similarly, we need a function to generate a batch of fake images and the associated target
(0.0).

```
# generate a batch of images, returns images and targets
def generate_fake_samples(g_model, dataset, patch_shape):
# generate fake instance
X = g_model.predict(dataset)
# create 'fake' class labels (0)
y = zeros((len(X), patch_shape, patch_shape, 1))
return X, y

```

Now, we can define the steps of a single training iteration. We will model the order of updates
based on the implementation in the official Torch implementation in the OptimizeParameters()
function3 (the official code uses a more confusing inverted naming convention).

1. Update Generator-B (A → B)
2. Update Discriminator-B
3. Update Generator-A (B → A)
4. Update Discriminator-A
3

https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN/blob/master/models/cycle_gan_model.lua#L230


First, we must select a batch of real images by calling generate real samples() for both
Domain-A and Domain-B. Typically, the batch size (n batch) is set to 1. In this case, we will
assume 256 × 256 input images, which means the n patch for the PatchGAN discriminator will
be 16.

```
...
# select a batch of real samples
X_realA, y_realA = generate_real_samples(trainA, n_batch, n_patch)
X_realB, y_realB = generate_real_samples(trainB, n_batch, n_patch)

```

Next, we can use the batches of selected real images to generate corresponding batches of
generated or fake images.

```
...
# generate a batch of fake samples
X_fakeA, y_fakeA = generate_fake_samples(g_model_BtoA, X_realB, n_patch)
X_fakeB, y_fakeB = generate_fake_samples(g_model_AtoB, X_realA, n_patch)

```

The paper describes using a pool of previously generated images from which examples are
randomly selected and used to update the discriminator model, where the pool size was set to
50 images.

... [we] update the discriminators using a history of generated images rather than
the ones produced by the latest generators. We keep an image buffer that stores the
50 previously created images.

— Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, 2017.
This can be implemented using a list for each domain and a using a function to populate the pool, then randomly replace elements from the pool once it is at capacity. The
update image pool() function below implements this based on the official Torch implementation in image pool.lua4 .

```
# update image pool for fake images
def update_image_pool(pool, images, max_size=50):
selected = list()
for image in images:
if len(pool) < max_size:
# stock the pool
pool.append(image)
selected.append(image)
elif random() < 0.5:
# use image, but don't add it to the pool
selected.append(image)
else:
# replace an existing image and use replaced image
ix = randint(0, len(pool))
selected.append(pool[ix])
pool[ix] = image
4

https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN/blob/master/util/image_pool.lua


return asarray(selected)

```

We can then update our image pool with generated fake images, the results of which can be
used to train the discriminator models.

```
...
# update fakes from pool
X_fakeA = update_image_pool(poolA, X_fakeA)
X_fakeB = update_image_pool(poolB, X_fakeB)

```

Next, we can update Generator-A. The train on batch() function will return a value for
each of the four loss functions, one for each output, as well as the weighted sum (first value)
used to update the model weights which we are interested in.

```
...
# update generator B->A via adversarial and cycle loss
g_loss2, _, _, _, _ = c_model_BtoA.train_on_batch([X_realB, X_realA], [y_realA, X_realA,
X_realB, X_realA])

```

We can then update the discriminator model using the fake images that may or may not
have come from the image pool.

```
...
# update discriminator for A -> [real/fake]
dA_loss1 = d_model_A.train_on_batch(X_realA, y_realA)
dA_loss2 = d_model_A.train_on_batch(X_fakeA, y_fakeA)

```

We can then do the same for the other generator and discriminator models.

```
...
# update generator A->B via adversarial and cycle loss
g_loss1, _, _, _, _ = c_model_AtoB.train_on_batch([X_realA, X_realB], [y_realB, X_realB,
X_realA, X_realB])
# update discriminator for B -> [real/fake]
dB_loss1 = d_model_B.train_on_batch(X_realB, y_realB)
dB_loss2 = d_model_B.train_on_batch(X_fakeB, y_fakeB)

```

At the end of the training run, we can then report the current loss for the discriminator
models on real and fake images and of each generator model.

```
...
# summarize performance
print('>%d, dA[%.3f,%.3f] dB[%.3f,%.3f] g[%.3f,%.3f]' % (i+1, dA_loss1,dA_loss2,
dB_loss1,dB_loss2, g_loss1,g_loss2))

```

Tying this all together, we can define a function named train() that takes an instance
of each of the defined models and a loaded dataset (list of two NumPy arrays, one for each

domain) and trains the model. A batch size of 1 is used as is described in the paper and the
models are fit for 100 training epochs.

```
# train cyclegan models
def train(d_model_A, d_model_B, g_model_AtoB, g_model_BtoA, c_model_AtoB, c_model_BtoA,
dataset):
# define properties of the training run
n_epochs, n_batch, = 100, 1
# determine the output square shape of the discriminator
n_patch = d_model_A.output_shape[1]
# unpack dataset
trainA, trainB = dataset
# prepare image pool for fakes
poolA, poolB = list(), list()
# calculate the number of batches per training epoch
bat_per_epo = int(len(trainA) / n_batch)
# calculate the number of training iterations
n_steps = bat_per_epo * n_epochs
# manually enumerate epochs
for i in range(n_steps):
# select a batch of real samples
X_realA, y_realA = generate_real_samples(trainA, n_batch, n_patch)
X_realB, y_realB = generate_real_samples(trainB, n_batch, n_patch)
# generate a batch of fake samples
X_fakeA, y_fakeA = generate_fake_samples(g_model_BtoA, X_realB, n_patch)
X_fakeB, y_fakeB = generate_fake_samples(g_model_AtoB, X_realA, n_patch)
# update fakes from pool
X_fakeA = update_image_pool(poolA, X_fakeA)
X_fakeB = update_image_pool(poolB, X_fakeB)
# update generator B->A via adversarial and cycle loss
g_loss2, _, _, _, _ = c_model_BtoA.train_on_batch([X_realB, X_realA], [y_realA,
X_realA, X_realB, X_realA])
# update discriminator for A -> [real/fake]
dA_loss1 = d_model_A.train_on_batch(X_realA, y_realA)
dA_loss2 = d_model_A.train_on_batch(X_fakeA, y_fakeA)
# update generator A->B via adversarial and cycle loss
g_loss1, _, _, _, _ = c_model_AtoB.train_on_batch([X_realA, X_realB], [y_realB,
X_realB, X_realA, X_realB])
# update discriminator for B -> [real/fake]
dB_loss1 = d_model_B.train_on_batch(X_realB, y_realB)
dB_loss2 = d_model_B.train_on_batch(X_fakeB, y_fakeB)
# summarize performance
print('>%d, dA[%.3f,%.3f] dB[%.3f,%.3f] g[%.3f,%.3f]' % (i+1, dA_loss1,dA_loss2,
dB_loss1,dB_loss2, g_loss1,g_loss2))

```

The train function can then be called directly with our defined models and loaded dataset.

```
...
# load a dataset as a list of two arrays
dataset = ...
# train models
train(d_model_A, d_model_B, g_model_AtoB, g_model_BtoA, c_model_AtoB, c_model_BtoA, dataset)

```


As an improvement, it may be desirable to combine the update to each discriminator model
into a single operation as is performed in the fDx basic() function of the official implementation5 .
Additionally, the paper describes updating the models for another 100 epochs (200 in total),
where the learning rate is decayed to 0.0. This too can be added as a minor extension to the
training process.
