## How to Develop a Semi-Supervised GAN (SGAN)

Semi-supervised learning is the challenging problem of training a classifier in a dataset that
contains a small number of labeled examples and a much larger number of unlabeled examples.
The Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, is an architecture that makes effective use of
large, unlabeled datasets to train an image generator model via an image discriminator model.
The discriminator model can be used as a starting point for developing a classifier model in
some cases.
The semi-supervised GAN, or SGAN, model is an extension of the GAN architecture that
involves the simultaneous training of a supervised discriminator, unsupervised discriminator,
and a generator model. The result is both a supervised classification model that generalizes
well to unseen examples and a generator model that outputs plausible examples of images from
the domain. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a Semi-Supervised Generative
Adversarial Network from scratch. After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- The semi-supervised GAN is an extension of the GAN architecture for training a classifier
model while making use of labeled and unlabeled data.
- There are at least three approaches to implementing the supervised and unsupervised
discriminator models in Keras used in the semi-supervised GAN.
- How to train a semi-supervised GAN from scratch on MNIST and load and use the trained
classifier for making predictions.

Let’s get started.


## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is divided into four parts; they are:

1. What Is the Semi-Supervised GAN?
2. How to Implement the Semi-Supervised Discriminator
3. How to Develop a Semi-Supervised GAN for MNIST
4. How to Use the Final SGAN Classifier Model



## What Is the Semi-Supervised GAN?

Semi-supervised learning refers to a problem where a predictive model is required and there
are few labeled examples and many unlabeled examples. The most common example is a
classification predictive modeling problem in which there may be a very large dataset of
examples, but only a small fraction have target labels. The model must learn from the small
set of labeled examples and somehow harness the larger dataset of unlabeled examples in
order to generalize to classifying new examples in the future. The Semi-Supervised GAN, or
sometimes SGAN for short, is an extension of the Generative Adversarial Network architecture
for addressing semi-supervised learning problems.

One of the primary goals of this work is to improve the effectiveness of generative
adversarial networks for semi-supervised learning (improving the performance of
a supervised task, in this case, classification, by learning on additional unlabeled
examples).

— Improved Techniques for Training GANs, 2016.

The discriminator in a traditional GAN is trained to predict whether a given image is real
(from the dataset) or fake (generated), allowing it to learn features from unlabeled images.
The discriminator can then be used via transfer learning as a starting point when developing
a classifier for the same dataset, allowing the supervised prediction task to benefit from the
unsupervised training of the GAN. In the Semi-Supervised GAN, the discriminator model is
updated to predict K + 1 classes, where K is the number of classes in the prediction problem
and the additional class label is added for a new fake class. It involves directly training the
discriminator model for both the unsupervised GAN task and the supervised classification task
simultaneously.

We train a generative model G and a discriminator D on a dataset with inputs
belonging to one of N classes. At training time, D is made to predict which of N + 1
classes the input belongs to, where an extra class is added to correspond to the
outputs of G.

— Semi-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks, 2016.

As such, the discriminator is trained in two modes: a supervised and unsupervised mode.

- Unsupervised Training: In the unsupervised mode, the discriminator is trained in the
same way as the traditional GAN, to predict whether the example is either real or fake.

- Supervised Training: In the supervised mode, the discriminator is trained to predict
the class label of real examples.

Training in unsupervised mode allows the model to learn useful feature extraction capabilities
from a large unlabeled dataset, whereas training in supervised mode allows the model to use
the extracted features and apply class labels. The result is a classifier model that can achieve
state-of-the-art results on standard problems such as MNIST when trained on very few labeled
examples, such as tens, hundreds, or one thousand. Additionally, the training process can also

result in better quality images output by the generator model. For example, Augustus Odena
in his 2016 paper titled Semi-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks shows
how a GAN-trained classifier is able to perform as well as or better than a standalone CNN
model on the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task when trained with 25, 50, 100, and
1,000 labeled examples.

## How to Implement the Semi-Supervised Discriminator

There are a number of ways that we can implement the discriminator model for the semisupervised GAN. In this section, we will review three candidate approaches.


## Traditional Discriminator Model

Consider a discriminator model for the standard GAN model. It must take an image as input
and predict whether it is real or fake. More specifically, it predicts the likelihood of the input
image being real. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function to predict a probability
value in [0,1] and the model is typically optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function.
For example, we can define a simple discriminator model that takes grayscale images as input
with the size of 28 × 28 pixels and predicts a probability of the image being real. We can use
best practices and downsample the image using convolutional layers with a 2 × 2 stride and
a leaky ReLU activation function. The define discriminator() function below implements
this and defines our standard discriminator model.

```
# example of defining the discriminator model
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers import Conv2D
from keras.layers import LeakyReLU
from keras.layers import Dropout
from keras.layers import Flatten
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.utils.vis_utils import plot_model
# define the standalone discriminator model
def define_discriminator(in_shape=(28,28,1)):
# image input
in_image = Input(shape=in_shape)
# downsample
fe = Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(in_image)
fe = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(fe)
# downsample
fe = Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(fe)
fe = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(fe)
# downsample
fe = Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(fe)
fe = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(fe)
# flatten feature maps
fe = Flatten()(fe)
# dropout
fe = Dropout(0.4)(fe)
# output layer
d_out_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(fe)
# define and compile discriminator model
d_model = Model(in_image, d_out_layer)
d_model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5))
return d_model
# create model
model = define_discriminator()
# plot the model
plot_model(model, to_file='discriminator_plot.png', show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)

```

shape of the input image and the prediction of a single probability value.

installed. If this is a problem, you can comment out the import statement and the function call
for plot model().

![](../images/443-106.jpg)



## Separate Discriminator Models With Shared Weights

Starting with the standard GAN discriminator model, we can update it to create two models
that share feature extraction weights. Specifically, we can define one classifier model that
predicts whether an input image is real or fake, and a second classifier model that predicts the
class of a given model.
- **Binary Classifier Model.** Predicts whether the image is real or fake, sigmoid activation
function in the output layer, and optimized using the binary cross-entropy loss function.

- **Multiclass Classifier Model.** Predicts the class of the image, softmax activation
function in the output layer, and optimized using the categorical cross-entropy loss
function.

Both models have different output layers but share all feature extraction layers. This means
that updates to one of the classifier models will impact both models. The example below creates
the traditional discriminator model with binary output first, then re-uses the feature extraction
layers and creates a new multiclass prediction model, in this case with 10 classes.

```
# example of defining semi-supervised discriminator model
from keras.models import Model

from keras.layers import Dropout

# define the standalone supervised and unsupervised discriminator models

fe = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(fe)
# downsample
fe = Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(fe)
fe = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(fe)
# downsample
fe = Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(fe)
fe = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(fe)
# flatten feature maps
fe = Flatten()(fe)
# dropout
fe = Dropout(0.4)(fe)
# unsupervised output
d_out_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(fe)
# define and compile unsupervised discriminator model
d_model = Model(in_image, d_out_layer)
d_model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5))
# supervised output
c_out_layer = Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax')(fe)
# define and compile supervised discriminator model
c_model = Model(in_image, c_out_layer)
c_model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0002,
beta_1=0.5), metrics=['accuracy'])
return d_model, c_model
# create model
d_model, c_model = define_discriminator()
# plot the model
plot_model(d_model, to_file='discriminator1_plot.png', show_shapes=True,
show_layer_names=True)

plot_model(c_model, to_file='discriminator2_plot.png', show_shapes=True,
show_layer_names=True)

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `02_summarize_separate_discriminators.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Running the example creates and plots both models. The plot for the first model is the
same as before. The plot of the second model shows the same expected input shape and same
feature extraction layers, with a new 10 class classification output layer.

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Creating a plot of the model assumes that the pydot and graphviz libraries are
installed. If this is a problem, you can comment out the import statement and the function call
for plot model().

![](../images/445-107.jpg)



## Single Discriminator Model With Multiple Outputs

Another approach to implementing the semi-supervised discriminator model is to have a single
model with multiple output layers. Specifically, this is a single model with one output layer for
the unsupervised task and one output layer for the supervised task. This is like having separate
models for the supervised and unsupervised tasks in that they both share the same feature
extraction layers, except that in this case, each input image always has two output predictions,
specifically a real/fake prediction and a supervised class prediction.
A problem with this approach is that when the model is updated with unlabeled and
generated images, there is no supervised class label. In that case, these images must have an
output label of unknown or fake from the supervised output. This means that an additional
class label is required for the supervised output layer. The example below implements the
multi-output single model approach for the discriminator model in the semi-supervised GAN
architecture. We can see that the model is defined with two output layers and that the output
layer for the supervised task is defined with n classes + 1, in this case 11, making room for
the additional unknown class label. We can also see that the model is compiled to two loss
functions, one for each output layer of the model.

```

# supervised output

# define and compile supervised discriminator model
model = Model(in_image, [d_out_layer, c_out_layer])
model.compile(loss=['binary_crossentropy', 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'],
optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5), metrics=['accuracy'])

return model
# create model
model = define_discriminator()
# plot the model
plot_model(model, to_file='multioutput_discriminator_plot.png', show_shapes=True,
show_layer_names=True)

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `03_summarize_multi_output_discriminator.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Running the example creates and plots the single multi-output model. The plot clearly
shows the shared layers and the separate unsupervised and supervised output layers.

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Creating a plot of the model assumes that the pydot and graphviz libraries are
installed. If this is a problem, you can comment out the import statement and the function call

![](../images/447-108.jpg)


## Stacked Discriminator Models With Shared Weights

A final approach is very similar to the prior two semi-supervised approaches and involves creating
separate logical unsupervised and supervised models but attempts to reuse the output layers of
one model to feed as input into another model. The approach is based on the definition of the
semi-supervised model in the 2016 paper by Tim Salimans, et al. from OpenAI titled Improved
Techniques for Training GANs. In the paper, they describe an efficient implementation, where
first the supervised model is created with K output classes and a softmax activation function.
The unsupervised model is then defined that takes the output of the supervised model prior to
the softmax activation, then calculates a normalized sum of the exponential outputs.

![](../images/6.jpg)

To make this clearer, we can implement this activation function in NumPy and run some
sample activations through it to see what happens. The complete example is listed below.

```
# example of custom activation function
import numpy as np
# custom activation function
def custom_activation(output):
logexpsum = np.sum(np.exp(output))
result = logexpsum / (logexpsum + 1.0)
return result
# all -10s
output = np.asarray([-10.0, -10.0, -10.0])
print(custom_activation(output))
# all -1s
output = np.asarray([-1.0, -1.0, -1.0])
print(custom_activation(output))
# all 0s
output = np.asarray([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
print(custom_activation(output))
# all 1s
output = np.asarray([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
print(custom_activation(output))
# all 10s
output = np.asarray([10.0, 10.0, 10.0])
print(custom_activation(output))

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `04_custom_activation.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Remember, the output of the unsupervised model prior to the softmax activation function
will be the activations of the nodes directly. They will be small positive or negative values, but
not normalized, as this would be performed by the softmax activation. The custom activation
function will output a value between 0.0 and 1.0. A value close to 0.0 is output for a small or
negative activation and a value close to 1.0 for a positive or large activation. We can see this
when we run the example.

```
0.00013618124143106674
0.5246331135813284
0.75


0.890768227426964
0.9999848669190928

```

This means that the model is encouraged to output a strong class prediction for real examples,
and a small class prediction or low activation for fake examples. It’s a clever trick and allows
the re-use of the same output nodes from the supervised model in both models. The activation
function can be implemented almost directly via the Keras backend and called from a Lambda
layer, e.g. a layer that will apply a custom function to the input to the layer.
The complete example is listed below. First, the supervised model is defined with a softmax
activation and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The unsupervised model is stacked on top
of the output layer of the supervised model before the softmax activation, and the activations
of the nodes pass through our custom activation function via the Lambda layer. No need for
a sigmoid activation function as we have already normalized the activation. As before, the
unsupervised model is fit using binary cross-entropy loss.

Now that we have seen how to implement the discriminator model in the semi-supervised
GAN, we can develop a complete example for image generation and semi-supervised classification.


## How to Develop a Semi-Supervised GAN for MNIST

In this section, we will develop a semi-supervised GAN model for the MNIST handwritten digit
dataset (described in Section 7.2). The dataset has 10 classes for the digits 0-9, therefore the
classifier model will have 10 output nodes. The model will be fit on the training dataset that
contains 60,000 examples. Only 100 of the images in the training dataset will be used with

labels, 10 from each of the 10 classes. We will start off by defining the models. We will use the
stacked discriminator model, exactly as defined in the previous section. Next, we can define
the generator model. In this case, the generator model will take as input a point in the latent
space and will use transpose convolutional layers to output a 28 × 28 grayscale image. The
define generator() function below implements this and returns the defined generator model.

```
# define the standalone generator model
def define_generator(latent_dim):
# image generator input
in_lat = Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
# foundation for 7x7 image
n_nodes = 128 * 7 * 7
gen = Dense(n_nodes)(in_lat)
gen = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(gen)
gen = Reshape((7, 7, 128))(gen)
# upsample to 14x14
gen = Conv2DTranspose(128, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(gen)
gen = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(gen)
# upsample to 28x28
gen = Conv2DTranspose(128, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same')(gen)
gen = LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)(gen)
# output
out_layer = Conv2D(1, (7,7), activation='tanh', padding='same')(gen)
# define model
model = Model(in_lat, out_layer)
return model

```

The generator model will be fit via the unsupervised discriminator model. We will use the
composite model architecture, common to training the generator model when implemented
in Keras. Specifically, weight sharing is used where the output of the generator model is
passed directly to the unsupervised discriminator model, and the weights of the discriminator
are marked as not trainable. The define gan() function below implements this, taking the
already-defined generator and discriminator models as input and returning the composite model
used to train the weights of the generator model.

```
# define the combined generator and discriminator model, for updating the generator
def define_gan(g_model, d_model):
# make weights in the discriminator not trainable
d_model.trainable = False
# connect image output from generator as input to discriminator
gan_output = d_model(g_model.output)
# define gan model as taking noise and outputting a classification
model = Model(g_model.input, gan_output)
# compile model
opt = Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=opt)
return model

```

We can load the training dataset and scale the pixels to the range [-1, 1] to match the output
values of the generator model.

```
# load the images

def load_real_samples():
# load dataset
(trainX, trainy), (_, _) = load_data()
# expand to 3d, e.g. add channels
X = expand_dims(trainX, axis=-1)
# convert from ints to floats
X = X.astype('float32')
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
X = (X - 127.5) / 127.5
print(X.shape, trainy.shape)
return [X, trainy]

```

We can also define a function to select a subset of the training dataset in which we keep the labels and train the supervised version of the discriminator model. The select supervised samples()
function below implements this and is careful to ensure that the selection of examples is random
and that the classes are balanced. The number of labeled examples is parameterized and set at
100, meaning that each of the 10 classes will have 10 randomly selected examples.

```
# select a supervised subset of the dataset, ensures classes are balanced
def select_supervised_samples(dataset, n_samples=100, n_classes=10):
X, y = dataset
X_list, y_list = list(), list()
n_per_class = int(n_samples / n_classes)
for i in range(n_classes):
# get all images for this class
X_with_class = X[y == i]
# choose random instances
ix = randint(0, len(X_with_class), n_per_class)
# add to list
[X_list.append(X_with_class[j]) for j in ix]
[y_list.append(i) for j in ix]
return asarray(X_list), asarray(y_list)

```

Next, we can define a function for retrieving a batch of real training examples. A sample
of images and labels is selected, with replacement. This same function can be used to retrieve
examples from the labeled and unlabeled dataset, later when we train the models. In the case
of the unlabeled dataset, we will ignore the labels.\

```
# select real samples
def generate_real_samples(dataset, n_samples):
# split into images and labels
images, labels = dataset
# choose random instances
ix = randint(0, images.shape[0], n_samples)
# select images and labels
X, labels = images[ix], labels[ix]
# generate class labels
y = ones((n_samples, 1))
return [X, labels], y

```


Next, we can define functions to help in generating images using the generator model. First,
the generate latent points() function will create a batch worth of random points in the
latent space that can be used as input for generating images. The generate fake samples()
function will call this function to generate a batch worth of images that can be fed to the
unsupervised discriminator model or the composite GAN model during training.

```
# generate points in latent space as input for the generator
def generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_samples):
# generate points in the latent space
z_input = randn(latent_dim * n_samples)
# reshape into a batch of inputs for the network
z_input = z_input.reshape(n_samples, latent_dim)
return z_input
# use the generator to generate n fake examples, with class labels
def generate_fake_samples(generator, latent_dim, n_samples):
# generate points in latent space
z_input = generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_samples)
# predict outputs
images = generator.predict(z_input)
# create class labels
y = zeros((n_samples, 1))
return images, y

```


Next, we can define a function to be called when we want to evaluate the performance of the
model. This function will generate and plot 100 images using the current state of the generator
model. This plot of images can be used to subjectively evaluate the performance of the generator
model. The supervised discriminator model is then evaluated on the entire training dataset,
and the classification accuracy is reported. Finally, the generator model and the supervised
discriminator model are saved to file, to be used later. The summarize performance() function
below implements this and can be called periodically, such as the end of every training epoch.
The results can be reviewed at the end of the run to select a classifier and even generator models.

```
# generate samples and save as a plot and save the model
def summarize_performance(step, g_model, c_model, latent_dim, dataset, n_samples=100):
# prepare fake examples
X, _ = generate_fake_samples(g_model, latent_dim, n_samples)
# scale from [-1,1] to [0,1]
X = (X + 1) / 2.0
# plot images
for i in range(100):
# define subplot
pyplot.subplot(10, 10, 1 + i)
# turn off axis

print('>Saved: %s, %s, and %s' % (filename1, filename2, filename3))

```


Next, we can define a function to train the models. The defined models and loaded training
dataset are provided as arguments, and the number of training epochs and batch size are
parameterized with default values, in this case 20 epochs and a batch size of 100. The chosen
model configuration was found to overfit the training dataset quickly, hence the relatively smaller
number of training epochs. Increasing the epochs to 100 or more results in much higher-quality
generated images, but a lower-quality classifier model. Balancing these two concerns might
make a fun extension.
First, the labeled subset of the training dataset is selected, and the number of training
steps is calculated. The training process is almost identical to the training of a vanilla GAN
model, with the addition of updating the supervised model with labeled examples. A single
cycle through updating the models involves first updating the supervised discriminator model
with labeled examples, then updating the unsupervised discriminator model with unlabeled real
and generated examples. Finally, the generator model is updated via the composite model.
The shared weights of the discriminator model get updated with 1.5 batches worth of samples,
whereas the weights of the generator model are updated with one batch worth of samples each
iteration. Changing this so that each model is updated by the same amount might improve the
model training process.

```
# train the generator and discriminator
def train(g_model, d_model, c_model, gan_model, dataset, latent_dim, n_epochs=20,
n_batch=100):
# select supervised dataset
X_sup, y_sup = select_supervised_samples(dataset)
print(X_sup.shape, y_sup.shape)
# calculate the number of batches per training epoch
bat_per_epo = int(dataset[0].shape[0] / n_batch)
# calculate the number of training iterations
n_steps = bat_per_epo * n_epochs
# calculate the size of half a batch of samples
half_batch = int(n_batch / 2)
print('n_epochs=%d, n_batch=%d, 1/2=%d, b/e=%d, steps=%d' % (n_epochs, n_batch,
half_batch, bat_per_epo, n_steps))
# manually enumerate epochs
for i in range(n_steps):
# update supervised discriminator (c)
[Xsup_real, ysup_real], _ = generate_real_samples([X_sup, y_sup], half_batch)
c_loss, c_acc = c_model.train_on_batch(Xsup_real, ysup_real)
# update unsupervised discriminator (d)
[X_real, _], y_real = generate_real_samples(dataset, half_batch)


d_loss1 = d_model.train_on_batch(X_real, y_real)
X_fake, y_fake = generate_fake_samples(g_model, latent_dim, half_batch)
d_loss2 = d_model.train_on_batch(X_fake, y_fake)
# update generator (g)
X_gan, y_gan = generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_batch), ones((n_batch, 1))
g_loss = gan_model.train_on_batch(X_gan, y_gan)
# summarize loss on this batch
print('>%d, c[%.3f,%.0f], d[%.3f,%.3f], g[%.3f]' % (i+1, c_loss, c_acc*100, d_loss1,
d_loss2, g_loss))
# evaluate the model performance every so often
if (i+1) % (bat_per_epo * 1) == 0:
summarize_performance(i, g_model, c_model, latent_dim, dataset)

```

Finally, we can define the models and call the function to train and save the models.

```
...
# size of the latent space
latent_dim = 100
# create the discriminator models
d_model, c_model = define_discriminator()
# create the generator
g_model = define_generator(latent_dim)
# create the gan
gan_model = define_gan(g_model, d_model)
# load image data
dataset = load_real_samples()
# train model
train(g_model, d_model, c_model, gan_model, dataset, latent_dim)

```

Tying all of this together, the complete example of training a semi-supervised GAN on the
MNIST handwritten digit image classification task is listed below.

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `06_train_sgan.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Running the example may take many hours to run on CPU hardware. I recommend
running the example on GPU hardware if possible. If you need help, you can get started
quickly by using an AWS EC2 instance to train the model.

At the start of the run, the size of the training dataset is summarized, as is the supervised
subset, confirming our configuration. The performance of each model is summarized at the end
of each update, including the loss and accuracy of the supervised discriminator model (c), the
loss of the unsupervised discriminator model on real and generated examples (d), and the loss
of the generator model updated via the composite model (g). The loss for the supervised model
will shrink to a small value close to zero and accuracy will hit 100%, which will be maintained

for the entire run. The loss of the unsupervised discriminator and generator should remain at
modest values throughout the run if they are kept in equilibrium.

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Your specific results may vary given the stochastic nature of the learning algorithm.
Consider running the example a few times and compare the average performance.

```

>5, c[2.254,18], d[0.077,2.407], g[0.095]
...

```

The supervised classification model is evaluated on the entire training dataset at the end of
every training epoch, in this case after every 600 training updates. At this time, the performance
of the model is summarized, showing that it rapidly achieves good skill. This is surprising given
that the model is only trained on 10 labeled examples of each class.

The models are also saved at the end of each training epoch and plots of generated images
are also created. The quality of the generated images is good given the relatively small number
of training epochs.

## How to Use the Final SGAN Classifier Model

Now that we have trained the generator and discriminator models, we can make use of them. In
the case of the semi-supervised GAN, we are less interested in the generator model and more
interested in the supervised model. Reviewing the results for the specific run, we can select a
specific saved model that is known to have good performance on the test dataset. In this case,
the model saved after 12 training epochs, or 7,200 updates, that had a classification accuracy of
about 95.432% on the training dataset. We can load the model directly via the load model()
Keras function.

```
...
# load the model
model = load_model('c_model_7200.h5')

```

Once loaded, we can evaluate it on the entire training dataset again to confirm the finding,
then evaluate it on the holdout test dataset. Recall, the feature extraction layers expect the
input images to have the pixel values scaled to the range [-1,1], therefore, this must be performed

before any images are provided to the model. The complete example of loading the saved
semi-supervised classifier model and evaluating it in the complete MNIST dataset is listed below.

```
# example of loading the classifier model and generating images
from numpy import expand_dims
from keras.models import load_model
from keras.datasets.mnist import load_data
# load the model
model = load_model('c_model_7200.h5')
# load the dataset
(trainX, trainy), (testX, testy) = load_data()
# expand to 3d, e.g. add channels
trainX = expand_dims(trainX, axis=-1)
testX = expand_dims(testX, axis=-1)
# convert from ints to floats
trainX = trainX.astype('float32')
testX = testX.astype('float32')
# scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
trainX = (trainX - 127.5) / 127.5
testX = (testX - 127.5) / 127.5
# evaluate the model
_, train_acc = model.evaluate(trainX, trainy, verbose=0)
print('Train Accuracy: %.3f%%' % (train_acc * 100))
_, test_acc = model.evaluate(testX, testy, verbose=0)
print('Test Accuracy: %.3f%%' % (test_acc * 100))

```

##### Run Notebook
Click notebook `07_inference_sgan.ipynb` in jupterLab UI and run jupyter notebook.

Running the example loads the model and evaluates it on the MNIST dataset.\

<h5><span style="color:red;">Note:</span></h5> Your specific results may vary given the stochastic nature of the learning algorithm.
Consider running the example a few times and compare the average performance.

In this case, we can see that the model achieves the expected performance of 95.432% on
the training dataset, confirming we have loaded the correct model. We can also see that the
accuracy on the holdout test dataset is as good, or slightly better, at about 95.920%. This
shows that the learned classifier has good generalization.

```
Train Accuracy: 95.432%
Test Accuracy: 95.920%

```

We have successfully demonstrated the training and evaluation of a semi-supervised classifier
model fit via the GAN architecture.

## Extensions

This section lists some ideas for extending the tutorial that you may wish to explore.

- Standalone Classifier. Fit a standalone classifier model on the labeled dataset directly
and compare performance to the SGAN model.
- Number of Labeled Examples. Repeat the example of more or fewer labeled examples
and compare the performance of the model
- Model Tuning. Tune the performance of the discriminator and generator model to
further lift the performance of the supervised model closer toward state-of-the-art results.

If you explore any of these extensions, I’d love to know.
