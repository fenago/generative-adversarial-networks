# Generative Adversarial Networks with Python

### Overview
Deep Learning Generative Models for Image Synthesis and Image Translation

### Description
Generative Adversarial Networks, or
GANs for short, are a deep learning technique for training generative models. GANs are most
commonly used for the generation of synthetic images for a specific domain that are different
and practically indistinguishable from other real images. The study and application of GANs are
only a few years old, yet the results achieved have been nothing short of remarkable. Because
the field is so young, it can be challenging to know how to get started, what to focus on, and
how to best use the available techniques. This course is designed to teach you step-by-step how
to bring the best and most promising aspects of the exciting field of Generative Adversarial
Networks to your own projects.
